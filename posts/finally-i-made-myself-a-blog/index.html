<p>There is no secret that having a blog is no big deal. Nowadays, everybody can create and host
a blog with ease. So I though&hellip; why shouldn&rsquo;t I have a blog?</p>

<p>I always wanted to write about different things that bug or incite me, write a couple
of words about some interesting things I do or see other people do, offer some tips
about the problems that every programmer once had, etc.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, I searched a method to create a free blog without any major
complications and drama. I researched a little and I tried some of the most popular
choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>using Blogger (Google&rsquo;s platform for blogging)</li>
<li>using Wordpress</li>
<li>using Jekyll</li>
<li>using Pelican</li>
<li>using Hugo</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these tools have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h3 id="blogger">Blogger</h3>

<p>My first choice was blogger. Why? Because Google owns us, of course.</p>

<p>Joking aside, it came very easy to start a blog using their platform, as I use Google Chrome as
my main browser and I am logged in with my GMail account.</p>

<p>The main advantage was that it was easy to start a blog from scratch and publish the first post.
But that was not enough for me. The lack of customization for my blog made me reconsider my choice
and look further for alternatives. More precisely, they have just a bunch of available themes
and they all look &hellip;  let&rsquo;s just say, not appealing. I had to find something that could be easily
customizable without loosing its functionality.</p>

<h3 id="wordpress">Wordpress</h3>

<p>After the Blogger dissapointment, I moved on to Wordpress, the great platform for blogging.
I created an account, I created a blog, I created a new post, published it&hellip; but I knew something
was missing&hellip; It was all so complicated, everything was so customizable with so many options that
I was losing myself in those details.</p>

<p>The next day when I wanted to check out how everything is going, the browser started to crash when I
was accessing their site with an &ldquo;Out of memory&rdquo; error. That was unpleasant and frustrating as I was
unable to access the platform. I had to find something else.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h3>

<p>After a while, I heard about some static site generators. I knew, in essence, what they were because I
used Sphinx to convert RST markup to Python documentation, but I never actually got in touch with
other static site generators other than that. With one search on Google, I found this little tool
named Jekyll (an odd name, to be honest). I followed all their steps in the tutorial and I was
able to generate a mini-blog with a hello world. But I didn&rsquo;t quite like it because I had to install
a bunch of new packages (ruby, gem, some other packages that I had to install because
of some weird errors) just to run Jekyll and generate some HTML pages. Being a Python developer, I said
that there has to be something similar for Python.</p>

<h3 id="pelican">Pelican</h3>

<p>After searching for a few minutes, I stumbled upon <strong>Pelican</strong> - a static site generator written in
Python. After the usual <code>pip install ...</code> thingy, everything was ready. I followed their tutorial
and found out that everything was so easy&hellip; and free&hellip; and from the comfort of my own hardware,
not on the platform of some corporation. It felt right, it was easy, it was fast.</p>

<p>And now, I am using this method of writing a blog and I sincerely recommend it!</p>

<h3 id="hugo">Hugo</h3>

<p>After a while of playing with Pelican I searched for alternatives and
I found about Hugo, another static site generator, but this time it
was written in Golang. I said to myself that I should give it a chance.
 A huge plus was the huge theme repository that looked better than the
 ones Pelican provided. I downloaded the Hugo executable, created the
 structure and started to search through the themes until I found one
 that I liked. I used that theme, wrote some dummy articles and everything
 was fine.
Until the next day, when I decided to trigger a build on other laptop&hellip;
Long story short, everything failed violently and burst into flames because
I attempted to use the reST syntax, instead of the default Markdown syntax.
 I later found that the reST support is at an early stage, very experimental and it attempts to run rst2html.py for whatever Python distribution it finds on your local machine (and the weird part is that I had docutils installed, therefore the rst2html.py script was where it was supposed to be, but that Go executable was attempting to execute C:\path\to\rst2html.py as an executable, without the use of the Python interpreter.. what the actual Hell).
After that, I thought that it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, I could write my articles
 in Markdown.
But after a few minutes, I researched a little and wanted to do some
changes in the theme templates so that I could customize some things.
Then I realized, when looking over those Go templates that &hellip; damn &hellip;
that template language was ugly&hellip; I certainly liked the Jinja2 templates
Pelican uses more than the templating language Hugo was using. But this
is just my personal opinion clearly biased towards Python, Pelican and
Jinja2.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-pelican">Back to Pelican</h3>

<p>After the big Hugo disappointment, I decided to go back to using
Pelican. In the end, Python is not going to disappoint me, at least
not yet.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-hugo">Back to Hugo</h3>

<p>After a while, Pelican disappointed me: I just couldn&rsquo;t find a theme
that looked nice from my point of view. I found a bunch but they were very
outdated (didn&rsquo;t even work with the latest version of Pelican) and the
last update was at least one year ago while they had open unresolved
issues. In conclusion, they seemed abandoned and incompatible with
the latest version of Pelican.</p>

<p>So, I decided to give Hugo another chance. This time I will use Markdown
for my posts and I hope there will not be any issues with the build and
publish process. After spending a whole day trying different themes,
I settled down to one, converted all my posts to markdown and updatet
my blog. Let&rsquo;s hope this is the final change :)</p>
