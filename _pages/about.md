title: About myself
permalink: /about/

My name is Vlad Calin, I am a Python developer which is passionate about
basically anything related to programming.

I enjoy spending time experimenting with new technologies, exploring new
hot topics and improving myself continuously. I also enjoy reading about
machine learning, artificial intelligence, information security and big data.

I prefer to expand my knowledge horizontally, mainly because I don't consider
that being expert in a certain technology is a must. I say this because
technologies appear and disappear quickly as the industry evolves, and a
programming language or framework is just a tool used to resolve a set of
problems.

I believe that having a good understanding on a broad range of topics can
help an individual see (and understand) the big picture and adapt
accordingly.

Very briefly, my skill set includes Python, Windows and Linux operating
systems knowledge, various RDBMS and NoSQL engines and Docker.
