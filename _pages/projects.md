Currently, in my spare time I write code for the following personal projects:

- [gemstone](https://github.com/vladcalin/gemstone) - a Python library for
  writing JSON RPC based microservices
- [crawlster](https://github.com/vladcalin/crawlster) - a generic crawling
  library
- [taswor](https://github.com/vladcalin/taswor) - a toy framework that generates
  a static HTML page with some graphs, based on the execution of some
  predefined tasks, highlighting the dependencies between them.
- [fillmydb](https://github.com/vladcalin/fillmydb) - a tool for easily
  filling a database defined by some ORM models (django or peewee, sqlalchemy
  was also in plan but I got bored of this before implementing it) with fake
  realistic-looking test data.
