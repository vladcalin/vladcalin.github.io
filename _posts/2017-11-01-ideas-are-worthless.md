title: Ideas are worthless
category: Entrepreneurship

In the last few weeks or so, I spent quite much time reading forums, blogs, posts and whatnot about
entrepreneurship mainly because, at some point in the future, I am interested in pursuing such a path.

During this time, my main focus was on reading as much as possible about startups, success stories, 
fail stories, tips and tricks from other business owners and many others, while going to various
local relevant meetups.


I saw a lot of posts of people asking: "How can I make sure that nobody steals my idea?". I participated
at a local meetup whose purpose was to answer the question "What is the worth of my idea?" and the answer was
very simple: nothing. Completely worthless. And I am going to tell you why.

Anybody can come with an idea, no matter how unique it seems at first.
